# DSonPSP

This branch of DSonPSP is a port of modern stable Desmume by HCFcoder.
It is effectively _completely_ unoptimised in its current state, but we hope to fix this and get games running respectably.

We are looking for help! We want your help if you are interested in:

- Replacing slow ARM7 interpreter with Exophase's gpSP dynarec (thanks to Exophase for permission!)
- Moving sound code to the Media Engine processor
- Re-working graphics code to run on the GPU
- Converting SDL calls to native PSP calls
- Optimizing DSonPSP using assembly code
